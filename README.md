# Project Name
SQL To-Do List

## Description
This project took two days to develop.

I wanted to create an app where the user could add items to a personal todo list. These list items could be marked as completed, or deleted permanetely from a database.

I was looking to use a number of technologies like SQL in order to interact with the information on the page, while having that reflected in the database.

### Prerequisites

- Node
- JQuery
- Javascript
- SQL
- CSS
- Axios


## Installation

1. Create a database named `weekend-to-do-app`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. I recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run start` in your terminal
5. Navigate to localhost:5000 in your browser to see the app

## Usage

1. Use the input box to add a new item to your list of todos
2. The item can be deleted from the list or marked as done

## Built With

- Node
- JQuery
- Javascript
- SQL
- CSS
- Axios
